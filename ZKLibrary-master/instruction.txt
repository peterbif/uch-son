ZKLibrary
ZKLibrary is PHP Library for ZK Time & Attendance Devices. This library is design to reading and writing data to attendance device (fingerprint, face recognition or RFID) using UDP protocol. This library is useful to comunicate between web server and attendance device directly without any addition program. This library is implemented in the form of class.

Web server must be connected to the attendance device via Local Area Network (LAN). The UDP port that is used in this communication is 4370. You can not change this port without changing firmware of the attendance device. So, you just use it.
